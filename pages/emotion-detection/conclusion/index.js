                <b>Words have Feelings: </b> Just like people, words can express
                different emotions. For example, &quot;happy,&quot;
                &quot;joyful,&quot; and &quot;excited&quot; all show positive
                feelings, while &quot;sad,&quot; &quot;disappointed,&quot; and
                &quot;lonely&quot; express sadness.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Detecting Emotions: </b> Computers are super smart at
                understanding patterns. Scientists and computer experts have
                taught computers to recognize these emotional patterns in the
                words we use. So, when you type, the computer can guess how
                you&apos;re feeling!
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Emoji Friends:</b> You know those cute emojis you use in your
                messages? They are like little helpers for computers. Emojis can
                give extra clues about emotions. ðŸ˜ƒ means happy, ðŸ˜¢ means sad,
                and there are emojis for all sorts of feelings!
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Helping Us:</b> Emotion recognition can be useful! For
                example, it helps to analyze customer reviews in business,
                monitoring patient feedback tn healthcare services, tweets in
                social media platform.
              </p>
              So, the next time you send a message or write a story, remember
              that computers can understand your emotions too! It&apos;s like
              having a friend who can read between the lines and know exactly
              how you feel.
